0. Assert the way the coefficients are saved is actually in (target_channel_n x source_channel_n format)



1. Test the generalization performance of the Full Ensembling (It should hopefully be more robust!)

-- Do a grid search of the different Ensembling models and schemes.
-- Also create some visualizations of that!
2. Create an Averaging with the OneToOne comparison (All singles averaged with 50% weighting to the original?)
3. Do Replacement of original with the OneToOne Comparison
4. Do Averaging of the LeaveOneOut setting (50/50)
5. Do Replacement of the original with the LeaveOneOut setting.

6. Test different architectures how the transfer of the representations works best

- The get_intermediate_model is broken for ResNets and DenseNets
- Make sure the activations are not extracted by those functions or they differ (sometimes after ReLU and sometimes not!)
- Make the get_linear_model get the rest of the architecture not considered feature extraction!
