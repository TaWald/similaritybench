"""
 We implemented the equalisation of the power spectra and phase noise in the Fourier
 domain.
 Conversionto frequency domain was accomplished by a fast Fourier transform through
 the application of the fft2() and then fftshift() functions of the Python package
 scipy.fftpack.
 This results in a matrix of complexnumbers F, which represents both the phases and
 amplitudes of the individual frequencies in one complexnumber.
 F is organised in symmetric pairs of complex numbers with just their imaginary part
 differing inits sign and cancelling each other out when reversing the Fourier
 transform again.
 When transforming F to polar coordinates, the angle represents the respective
 frequencyâ€™s phase and the distance from the origin represents its amplitude.
 Hence, we extracted the phases and amplitudes of the individual frequencies with the
 functions numpy.angle(F) and numpy.abs(F), respectively.
 Thepower equalisation experiment had two conditions: original and power-equalised (
 Figure 13).
 For the power-equalised images, we first calculated the mean amplitude spectrum over
 all test images, which showed the typical 1f shape [e.g.77,78].
 Thereafter,we set all images amplitudes to the mean amplitude spectrum. Since the
 power spectrum is the square of theamplitude spectrum, the images were essentially
 power-equalised
