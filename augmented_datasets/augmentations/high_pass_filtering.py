"""
The high-pass experimentalso had eight conditions.
 Standard deviations were 0.4, 0.45, 0.55, 0.7, 1, 1.5, 3 pixels and inf (original
 image) (Figure 11).
  The high-pass filtered images were produced by subtracting a low-pass filtered
  image as described above from the original image.
    However, many of the high-pass filtered imagesâ€™pixels fell outside the [0, 1] range.
     To resolve this, we calculated the difference between the mean pixel valueover
     all test images (0.4423) and the mean pixel value of the high-pass filtered image.
      That difference was addedback to the image. This had the effect that images
      approached a uniform mean grey image of value 0.4423 forlow standard deviations.
       For both experiments pixel values were clipped to the [0, 1] range, if lying
       outside afterthe filtering.
        This only happened for <0.001% of pixels with a mean clipped away value of
        <0.001 for the bothfiltering experiments
