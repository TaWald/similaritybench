For thesalt and pepper noise experiment, used in DNNtraining experiments,
 we also scaled the greyscale image to a contrast level of 30% prior to adding noise
 in orderto ensure maximal comparability with the uniform noise experiment.
 Salt and pepper noise, i.e. setting pixels toeither black or white, was drawn
 pixelwise with a certain probabilityp, p âˆˆ {0,10,20,35,50,65,80,95}%.
 See Figure 14 for example salt-and-pepper stimuli at all conditions
